Dynamic and user-friendly Typing Test website utilizing Flutter, Dart, and Firebase technologies, aiming to enhance typing skills and accuracy while providing a seamless user experience. The project encompasses customizable typing test sessions, highscore tracking, and a sophisticated vector-based accuracy comparator system to identify and highlight mistakes, thereby facilitating a comprehensive learning environment for users.

Key Features:

1. Customizable Typing Test Sessions:
Users can select their desired test time length, allowing for flexibility in practice sessions. This feature accommodates various user preferences and schedules, enhancing the user's engagement and motivation to improve typing skills.

2. Highscore Tracking with HiveDB:
The project employs HiveDB, a lightweight and efficient database solution, to save and manage user highscores. Each test session's performance is recorded and stored, enabling users to track their progress over time. The utilization of Hive ensures quick access to highscores, contributing to a smooth user experience.

4. Vector-Based Accuracy Comparator System:
The core innovation of the project lies in its accuracy comparator system. Leveraging vector-based analysis, the system detects and evaluates typing mistakes with exceptional precision. This system goes beyond traditional methods, allowing users to visualize their errors in real-time and understand the patterns in their typing mistakes. The accuracy comparator system empowers users to focus on specific areas of improvement, leading to more targeted practice and enhanced typing accuracy.

5. Real-time Mistake Highlighting:
As users type during the test, the system identifies errors and highlights them in real-time. This feature enables users to immediately identify and correct mistakes, fostering a proactive learning process and helping them build muscle memory for improved typing speed and accuracy.

6. Firebase Integration for User Management:
Firebase integration enables secure user authentication and management. Users can create accounts, log in securely, and retrieve their personal highscores from any device. Firebase also provides a reliable cloud infrastructure, ensuring seamless synchronization of data across multiple platforms.

7. User-Friendly Interface:
The website boasts an intuitive and visually appealing interface, enhancing the overall user experience. Clear instructions, aesthetically pleasing design elements, and easy navigation contribute to a welcoming and engaging environment for users of all skill levels.

In conclusion, my Typing Test website developed with Flutter, Dart, Firebase, and HiveDB redefines typing practice by offering customizable sessions, accurate mistake identification, and a seamless highscore tracking experience. This project not only assists users in honing their typing skills but also provides valuable insights into their progress. Its combination of cutting-edge technology and user-centric design makes it an ideal tool for individuals striving to enhance their typing proficiency.
